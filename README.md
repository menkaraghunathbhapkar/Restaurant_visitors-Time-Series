# Restaurant_visitors-Time-Series
It is a Time Series Model.
Model tries to look at sequential data on visitors to restaurant from 2016 onwards till april month in 2017 and tries to do prediction for next time interal.
Here I have tried to build SARIMA AND SARIMAX model which tries to take into consideration exogenous factor which are difficult to take into consideration while building normal  
ARIMA Model.
